Hello! Welcome to Marco Chan's website! I am a final year master's students at the [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto. 

I have a broad research interest on technologies that strengthen our backsliding democracy. From developing sociotechnical systems, combating misinformation, to exploring alternative economies to sustain democratic structures, I am interested in developing effective social technologies that address state surveillance, political polarization, and the entrenched systemic inequality in monetary resources. I am also interested in the design implications that enables social justice, technologies are instruments, it is the people’s heart, mind, and will that drives democracy.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Vera Khovanskaya](https://verakhovanskaya.github.io/) on my master's thesis and by Professor [Priyank Chandra](https://www.priyankc.com/) on my diasporic Hong Kong project as part of the [Socio-Technical Resistance and Ethical Technologies (STREET) Lab](https://www.streetlab.tech/). The two kind and beautiful souls who showed me the world by teaching me how to read and write!

The diasporic Hong Kong project is an empirical study being prepared for submission at two venues, one on risk management in diasporic organising at [the Journal of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)](https://link.springer.com/journal/10606), the other on identity construction and boundary work at the [Journal of Communication](https://academic.oup.com/JOC?login=true). My master's thesis examines how diasporic activism interacts with data practices, focusing on management of privacy, organized norms, and strategic coordination the occurs beyond the designed affordances of digital platforms with an end goal of submission to ACM CHI 2025. 

My academic background includes a Master of Information - Data Science and Information Systems from the University of Toronto, and a Bachelor of Business Administration - Management Sciences from the City University of Hong Kong. Prior to graduate school, I worked in various banks, stock exchange, Bloomberg, telecoms, semiconductors, and volunteered for pro-bono consulting, fundraising, and teaching disadvantaged students English.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I hope you are staying well. If you have any questions or if there’s anything I can assist you with, please do not hesitate to reach out!
