I am a final-year master student in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. I aspire to pursue a PhD in Human Computer Interactoin and am currently researching on the socio-technical infrastructure of diasporic social movements.

I have a broader research interest on technologies that rescue our backsliding democracy. From mis(dis)information on social media, AI Mediated Communication, to and specifically cryptography and decentralized financial systems. I aim focus on tactics and collective actions in leveraging them, as well as the design implications that supports social justice. Technologies are after all instruments, it is the people's heart, mind, and will that drives democracy.  

I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Vera Khovanskaya](https://verakhovanskaya.github.io/) on my master's thesis and by Profssor [Priyank Chandra](https://www.priyankc.com/) on my diasporic Hong Kong project as part of the [Socio-Technical Resistence and Ethical Technologies (STREET) Lab](https://www.streetlab.tech/). The two kind and beautiful souls who showed me the world by teaching me how to read and write :D

My academic background includes a Master of Information - Data Science and Information Systems from the University of Toronto, and a Bachelor of Business Administration - Management Sciences from the City University of Hong Kong. 

Prior to gradschool, I worked at various banks, stock exchange, bloomberg, telecoms, semiconductors, and volunteered for pro-bono consulting, fundraising, and teaching underprivileged kids English. 

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I hope you are staying well. If you have any questions or if there's aything I can assist you with, pease do not hesitate to reach out :)
