I am a final-year master's student in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. I aspire to pursue a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction and am currently researching on socio-technical infrastructure of diasporic social movements.

I have a broader research interest on technologies that strengthen our backsliding democracy. From combating mis(dis)information to exploring cryptography and decentralized financial systems, I aim to investigate strategies and collective actions in leveraging these technologies, as well as the design implications that supports social justice. Technologies, after all, are instruments, it is the people's heart, mind, and will that drives democracy.  

I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Vera Khovanskaya](https://verakhovanskaya.github.io/) on my master's thesis and by Profssor [Priyank Chandra](https://www.priyankc.com/) on my diasporic Hong Kong project as part of the [Socio-Technical Resistence and Ethical Technologies (STREET) Lab](https://www.streetlab.tech/). The two kind and beautiful souls who showed me the world by teaching me how to read and write!

My academic background includes a Master of Information - Data Science and Information Systems from the University of Toronto, and a Bachelor of Business Administration - Management Sciences from the City University of Hong Kong. 

Prior to gradschool, I worked in various banks, stock exchange, bloomberg, telecoms, semiconductors, and volunteered for pro-bono consulting, fundraising, and teaching disadvantaged students English. 

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I hope you are staying well. If you have any questions or if there's aything I can assist you with, pease do not hesitate to reach out!
