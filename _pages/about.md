Hello! 

This is Marco Chan's website. I am a final year master's students at the [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto. 

I have a broad research interest on technologies that strengthen our backsliding democracy. From combating misinformation to exploring cryptography and decentralized finance, I aim to investigate strategies and collective actions in deploying these technologies, as well as the design implications that supports social justice. Technologies are after all instruments, it is the people's haert, mind, and will that drives democracy. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Vera Khovanskaya](https://verakhovanskaya.github.io/) on my master's thesis and by Profssor [Priyank Chandra](https://www.priyankc.com/) on my diasporic Hong Kong project as part of the [Socio-Technical Resistence and Ethical Technologies (STREET) Lab](https://www.streetlab.tech/). The two kind and beautiful souls who showed me the world by teaching me how to read and write!

The diasporic Hong Kong project is an empirical study being prepared for submission at two venues, one on risk management in diasporic organising at [the Journal of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)](https://link.springer.com/journal/10606), the other on identity construction and boundary work at the [Journal of Communication](https://academic.oup.com/JOC?login=true). My master's thesis on data practices in social movements is currently at stage of literature review with an end goal of submission to ACM CHI. 

My academic background includes a Master of Information - Data Science and Information Systems from the University of Toronto, and a Bachelor of Business Administration - Management Sciences from the City University of Hong Kong. Prior to graduate school, I worked in various banks, stock exchange, bloomberg, telecoms, semiconductors, and volunteered for pro-bono consulting, fundraising, and teaching disadvantaged students English. 

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I hope you are staying well. If you have any questions or if there's aything I can assist you with, pease do not hesitate to reach out!
