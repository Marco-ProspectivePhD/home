Hello! Welcome to Marco Chan's website! I am a final year master's students at the [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto. 

My research interest focuses on technologies that bolster our increasingly fragile democracies. From designing community-based sociotechnical system, combatting against misinformation, to exploring alternative economies that sustain democratic structures, I am dedicated to creating effective social technologies that address state surveillance, political polarization, and the entrenched systemic inequality in wealth and power that results in vulnerablities to democratic structures. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Vera Khovanskaya](https://verakhovanskaya.github.io/) on my master's thesis and by Professor [Priyank Chandra](https://www.priyankc.com/) on my diasporic Hong Kong project as part of the [Socio-Technical Resistance and Ethical Technologies (STREET) Lab](https://www.streetlab.tech/). The two kind and beautiful souls who showed me the world by teaching me how to read and write!

The diasporic Hong Kong project is an empirical study being prepared for submission at two venues, one on risk management in diasporic organising at [the Journal of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)](https://link.springer.com/journal/10606), the other on identity construction and boundary work at the [Journal of Communication](https://academic.oup.com/JOC?login=true). My master's thesis examines how diasporic activism interacts with data practices, focusing on management of privacy, organized norms, and strategic coordination that occurs beyond the designed affordances of digital platforms with an end goal of submission to ACM CHI 2025. 

My academic background includes a Master of Information - Data Science and Information Systems from the University of Toronto, and a Bachelor of Business Administration - Management Sciences from the City University of Hong Kong. Prior to graduate school, I worked in various banks, stock exchange, Bloomberg, telecoms, semiconductors, and volunteered for pro-bono consulting, fundraising, and teaching disadvantaged students English.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I hope you are staying well. If you have any questions or if thereâ€™s anything I can assist you with, please do not hesitate to reach out!
