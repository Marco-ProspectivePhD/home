I am a final-year master student in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. I aspire to pursue a PhD in Human Computer Interactoin and am currently researching on the socio-technical infrastructure of diasporic social movements.

I have a broader research interest on technologies that rescue our backsliding democracy - From social media, AI, to cryptography, as well as tactics and collective actions in leveraging them. Technologies are supportive instruments, it is the people's heart, mind, and will that drives democracy after all.  

I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Vera Khovanskaya](https://verakhovanskaya.github.io/) on my master's thesis and by Profssor [Priyank Chandra](https://www.priyankc.com/) on my diasporic Hong Kong project as part of the [Socio-Technical Resistence and Ethical Technologies (STREET) Lab](https://www.streetlab.tech/). The two kind souls who showed me the world by teaching me how to read and write :D

My academic background includes a Master of Information - Data Science and Information Systems from the University of Toronto, and a Bachelor of Business Administration - Management Sciences from the City University of Hong Kong. 

Prior to gradschool, I worked at various banks, stock exchange, bloomberg, telecoms, semiconductors, and volunteered for pro-bono consulting, fundraising, teaching underprivileged kids English, and at times helped with redistribution of used goods. 

Thank you for learning about me. I hope you are staying well in life. Please feel free to reach out if there is anything I could help. May our paths cross in the future as we continue our adventure :)
