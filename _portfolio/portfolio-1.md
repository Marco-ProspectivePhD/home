excerpt: "Founded the [180 Degrees Consulting CityU Branch](https://hk.linkedin.com/company/180dc-cityu) after my academic exchange to Copenhagen with the hope of generating social impact in Hong Kong. It was back in the days during Covid-19 and I am eternally grateful for everyone who showed up to make this possible. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
